This script is a just a simple example of using Scapy.  After putting your wireless interface into monitor mode, run the script giving it the name of the monitor interface (monX) and it will begin pulling SSID Probes out of the air and display them. It'll also perform a lookup on the vendor portion of the MAC Addresses and attempt to identify the device.  All output will also be written to a file as when you're in a heavily populated area with a lot of WIFI devices the output will cycle through very fast.  

The concept of the script is based on an article by the great Ed Skoudis on the SANS website.

Have fun!
